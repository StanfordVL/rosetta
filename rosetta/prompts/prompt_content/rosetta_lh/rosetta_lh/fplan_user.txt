Think step-by-step to make a high-level plan for writing `skill_reward`. The plan should be a series of stages.
- Don't code yet, just plan the stages.
- Consider dependencies and conflicts between task stages, and create a plan that doesn't do anything counterproductive.

RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:
1. Use ONLY the stage templates you've been given.
2. Incorporate human feedback as given.
3. Do not add anything that contradicts the feedback.
4. Do not invent your own changes or speculate about what the feedback is going for.
5. Try accomplish the task goal with minimal stages. Long plans are harder to train on.
6. Make the plan complete - think about all the atomic stages the robot needs to achieve every part of the feedback, not just the final ones.
