You are being given code that is a training environment for a reinforcement learning-based robot. Code details:
1. `_load_scene`, `_initialize_episode`, and all the methods called by them, set up the scene.
2. `evaluate` calculates information about the current environment state in a dictionary. Its output dictionary is given to `compute_dense_reward` in the parameter `info`. 
3. `compute_dense_reward` outputs a final reward.
4. `get_fitness_score` outputs a final score

The code is as follows:
```python
$generated_env_code
```

This code has an error in it that you need to fix. The stack trace is as follows:
```python
$error_trace
```

The line that threw the error is `$error_line`.

Please fix it.
1. You cannot take debugging steps, you have to fix it without more info.
2. You should only edit `evaluate` and `compute_dense_reward` and `get_fitness_score` and any of their helper methods. Enclose them in markdown ```python <your code> ``` delimiters.
3. Don't use "```python ... ```" delimiters anywhere else in your response. You can use ` <code> ` if needed. 
3. If you would absolutely have to edit other methods to make the code work, you should instead say "this requires edits to restricted parts of the code. I can't continue." 
4. Follow the documentation below. Do not violate it.
5. OUTPUT THE WHOLE REVISED FUNCTION, NOT JUST A SNIPPET.
