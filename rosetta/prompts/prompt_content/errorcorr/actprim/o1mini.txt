You are being given code that is a training environment for a reinforcement learning-based robot. Code details:
1. `_load_scene`, `_initialize_episode`, and all the methods called by them, set up the scene.
2. `evaluate` calculates information about the current environment state in a dictionary. Its output dictionary is given to `skill_reward` in the parameters `prev_info` and `cur_info` - each represents `evaluate` called on a different environment state. 
3. `prev_info` and `cur_info` go through a conversion that turns their `torch.Tensor` values with batch dimensions into `numpy.ndarray` values WITHOUT a batch dimension.
3. `skill_reward` outputs a final reward.

The code is as follows:
```python
$generated_env_code
```

This code has an error in it that you need to fix. The stack trace is as follows:
```python
$error_trace
```

The line that threw the error is `$error_line`.

Please fix it.
1. You cannot take debugging steps, you have to fix it without more info.
2. You should only edit `evaluate` and `skill_reward` and any of their helper methods.
3. If you would absolutely have to edit other methods to make the code work, you should instead say "this requires edits to restricted parts of the code. I can't continue." 
4. OUTPUT THE WHOLE REVISED FUNCTION, NOT JUST A SNIPPET.
