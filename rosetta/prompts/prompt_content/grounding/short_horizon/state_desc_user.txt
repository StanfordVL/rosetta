Given the image from a robotic simulation, write a caption describing the scene.
Your response should be similar to the following examples:
EXAMPLE 1: A robot gripper is slightly above the sphere. The sphere is on the table, next to the bin.
EXAMPLE 2: The robot is holding a blue cube above the orange cube. The orange cube is on stacked on top of the pink cube.

$env_setup_description + $env_state_str Objects do not float. If an object is elevated, it is either held by the robot or stacked on top of another object.
