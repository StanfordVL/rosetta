The 3D coordinates of the projects [x,y,z] are defined from the viewerâ€™s perspective: the x-axis represents forward and backward, with positive values being closer and negative values farther away from the viewer; the y-axis denotes horizontal direction, with negative values to the left and positive to the right of the viewer. This is the opposite of typical - check your work!

The z-axis measures height, where z=0 corresponds to the table surface. Positions are measured at each object's center. Expect errors in the measurement.
