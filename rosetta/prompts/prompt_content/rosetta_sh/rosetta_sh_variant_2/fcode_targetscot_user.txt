- **Review your coordinate calculations.** For every target position or offset, did you explicitly define all three x, y, and z components?
  - **Common Pitfall:** Neglecting the z-axis. If you only reward x and y accuracy, the robot's vertical movement is undirected, which can lead to collisions. You must specify a complete 3D point.
- **Ensure your goals are specific.** Did you always guide the robot toward a precise point in space?
  - **Common Pitfall:** Providing a vague directional incentive (e.g., "move down"). This is insufficient; the robot needs a concrete target coordinate to move towards and stop at, otherwise it will move indefinitely.

1.  Verify the above points in your code.
2.  If corrections are needed, make them as concisely as possible.
3.  Output only the methods that you modify.
4.  When modifying a method, provide its complete source code, not just the changed lines.
5.  Do not add any new helper methods; restrict your edits to `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`.
6.  Add comments to explain your changes where necessary.
