- **Did you account for object dimensions?** Since `.pos()` returns an object's geometric center, did you apply the correct offsets (e.g., half-widths, radii) to accurately place objects relative to one another?
- **Did you consider all physical attributes?** For example, if placing an object inside a box, did you account for the thickness of the box's walls when calculating the target position?
- **Did you use the correct coordinate system?** Remember that in this environment, **x is front/back**, **y is left/right**, and **z is up/down**.
- **Are your penalties properly calibrated?** When discouraging a behavior like high speed, did you penalize speed *above* a certain limit, rather than penalizing *all* speed? The latter would incorrectly teach the robot to freeze.

1.  Verify the above points in your code.
2.  If corrections are needed, make them as concisely as possible.
3.  Output only the methods that you modify.
4.  When modifying a method, provide its complete source code, not just the changed lines.
5.  Do not add any new helper methods; restrict your edits to `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`.
6.  Add comments to explain your changes where necessary.
