- Did you consider each of the three coordinates for every position and offset you calculated? Common pitfalls:
  - Forgetting the z-component
  - Ignoring one or two coordinates when setting a target position. You have to set all three coordinates in your reward calculation, or the robot could collide. For example, if your reward is only on the x and y coordinates and lets the robot do whatever for z, it could crash into something else.
- Did you always set specific target positions to reach? Common pitfalls:
  - Simply incentivizing the robot to go in a certain direction (e.g. "down" or "below an object"). You should always push it toward a SPECIFIC POINT IN SPACE, or it won't stop and will fly wildly.

1. Verify.
2. If edits are necessary, make minimal versions of them.
3. Only output methods you are editing. 
4. If you are editing a method, output the whole edit method, not just your edits.
5. Don't introduce new methods, not even helper methods. Just edit `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`. 
6. Comment your code as needed.
