- Did you reason about the fact that `.pos()` returns the **center** location? Common pitfalls: 
  - Not applying the right offsets when trying to place two objects relative to each other. E.g. half-width, radius, etc.
- Did you reason about the physical attributes of each object and how they might offset target positions? Common pitfalls: 
  - Thickness of box walls
- Did you remember that unlike typical situations, x is the front-and-back axis while y is the left-and-right axis? z is still the up-and-down axis.
- When penalizing, did you remember not to OVER-penalize? For example, if you want slowness, penalizing ANY speed will make the robot go still and not do the task. Set a threshold instead.

1. Verify.
2. If edits are necessary, make minimal versions of them.
3. Only output methods you are editing. 
4. If you are editing a method, output the whole edit method, not just your edits.
5. Don't introduce new methods, not even helper methods. Just edit `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`. 
6. Comment your code as needed.
