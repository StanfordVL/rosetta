## Original code:
```python
$environment_code
```

## Feedback Context
Task before human review: $task_description  
Robot's behavior summary: $demo_summary  
User feedback: $grounded_preference

## Task
Create a step-by-step plan for rewriting `evaluate` and `compute_dense_reward`. Do not write code yet.

### Instructions:
- Break the task into clear stages, each representing a distinct environmental outcome.
- Ensure each stage builds on a feasible robot state from the previous step.
- Stay grounded in the robot's physical capabilities.
- Do not include robot actions—describe outcomes (e.g., object moved, robot arrived).
- Stages should reflect progress in the task, not final success only.

### Rules:
1. Integrate user feedback exactly—no assumptions or reinterpretations.
2. Don’t contradict feedback.
3. Don’t invent your own logic.
4. Avoid counterproductive goals.
5. Each stage = one environmental result.
6. Include all required stages, starting from initial state.
7. Do not include gripper release or staged movements like "move above then drop."
