- Did you include all three dimensions (x, y, z) when calculating positions and targets?
  - Omitting one (especially z) can lead to incorrect behavior or collisions.
- Did you define *exact* positions for the robot to aim for, not just general directions?
  - Saying “move down” isn’t enough—you must specify *where* to stop.

1. Review your code.
2. Make changes only if needed, and keep them minimal.
3. Only list updated methods.
4. For edited methods, include the full definition.
5. Don’t introduce helper functions—stick to `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`.
6. Use comments for clarity if helpful.
