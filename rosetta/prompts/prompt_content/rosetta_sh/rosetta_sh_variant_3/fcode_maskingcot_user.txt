For reward masking:
- Did you ensure the reward only increases over time, never decreasing as the task progresses?
  - Rewards should remain active even after a stage is completed.
  - For instance, grasping an item should still earn reward even after the item is being transported or released.
- Did you accidentally hide stage rewards too early?
  - Bad: masking "move object A next to object B" using `is_objA_next_to_objB`. This blocks any early reward signal and stops learning.
  - Bad: masking "go to target" with `is_near_target_pos`. That means no reward until it's already there!

1. Check your design.
2. If any fix is needed, change as little as possible.
3. Show only edited methods.
4. For modified methods, include the entire method.
5. Do not add new helper methods. Only touch `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`.
6. Use comments if needed.
