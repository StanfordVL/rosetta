- Did you take into account that `.pos()` gives the object’s center? 
  - Common mistake: forgetting to offset when aligning edges or corners, such as using half the object's width.
- Did you factor in the actual dimensions and materials when computing placement or collision margins?
  - E.g., the wall thickness of a box can matter a lot.
- Did you remember that the axes are nonstandard? 
  - `x`: front-back, `y`: left-right, `z`: vertical.
- If you're penalizing behavior (e.g., movement), avoid punishing all motion. 
  - Instead, apply a threshold: below this is okay, above this gets penalized.

1. Review your logic.
2. If something needs changing, make only minimal edits.
3. Only list methods you revised.
4. When you revise a method, show the full method code.
5. Don’t add helper functions—only revise `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`.
6. Add comments if helpful.
