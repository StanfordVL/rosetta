# Instructions

You are a reward designer who specializes in creating reward functions to address reinforcement learning challenges. You will produce outlines for two functions, `evaluate` and `compute_dense_reward`, in natural language. They should be specific and ready for coding.

You will receive: 
1. Code for a task environment class that a reinforcement learning-based agent has already been trained in. This includes the reward function the agent was trained on, specifically the existing version of `compute_dense_reward`.
2. Feedback provided to the agent by a human who observed it after it had been trained on the existing version of `compute_dense_reward`. 

You should:
1. Create a high level strategy for `compute_dense_reward`, and `evaluate` as required. `compute_dense_reward` is the reward function, and `evaluate` is a utility that analyzes the current environment state and compiles information that is provided to `compute_dense_reward`. 
2. Design a phased reward:
  - Divide the task into phases and provide the agent reward incrementally, motivating it to complete each phase. The reward should therefore accumulate, NOT be winner-takes-all at the conclusion.
  - Consider dependencies and trade-offs between different task phases and different elements of the feedback and overall objective. Ensure your reward design isn't detrimental.
3. If there are elements of the feedback that cannot be implemented without modifying other methods, state "I cannot implement <element>" and ONLY implement the other parts of the feedback, if any exist.
4. If there are elements of the feedback that are physically impossible, state "I cannot implement <element>" and ONLY implement the other parts of the feedback, if any exist.
5. Describe your reasoning at each step.

Each phase must be a **single result**. It must be a change in an environment state, not a specific action. It must follow one of the following templates: 
- Reward the agent for navigating to <target location>. Example: "reward the agent for navigating to the point immediately left of `cubeA`."
- Reward the agent for moving <target object> to <target location>. Example: "reward the agent for moving the bottle to be inside of the drawer." 
- Reward the agent for <other single result>. Example: "reward the agent for moving more fluidly." 
- Reward the agent for <other single descriptor> <other object>. Example: "reward the agent for aligning the top cube's edges with the bottom cube's edges."
Tips:
- Notice how the phase templates are highly atomic - one single result. 
- IMPORTANT: even if the human feedback has multiple components, your phases must STILL be atomic. Just because the person lists multiple components, this doesn't mean each component is a single phase. One component may still require multiple atomic phases, and one atomic phase may contribute to multiple feedback components. BE INTELLIGENT, DON'T JUST ENUMERATE THE FEEDBACK AS YOUR PHASES.
- Note how the phase templates address changes to the environment (including the agent) rather than the agent's actions.

### Details for `evaluate`
```python
def evaluate(self: BaseEnv) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
    """
    Return dict maps strings of reward-relevant queries to their boolean-valued responses for the batch. Thus, the values of this dict are torch.Tensors with bool dtype, where the first dimension represents a batch of episodes and the second is the boolean response to the string query for that specific episode.

    Should generate a useful collection of information. `evaluate` will be called on both the prior state (before the agent executed an action) and the current state (after the agent executed an action) to compute reward.
    """
```

### Details for `compute_dense_reward`
```python
def compute_dense_reward(self: BaseEnv, obs: Any, action: torch.Tensor, info: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]) -> torch.Tensor
    """
    Determines reward for each potential action based on `evaluate` output dictionary and other current environment information (environment instance attributes). 
    
    Implements human feedback as provided.

    Follows the following structure:
    1. Phase reward 
      - Task is divided into phases and reward is provided to the agent incrementally, motivating it to complete each phase. The reward accumulates.
      - Dependencies and trade-offs between different task phases and different elements of feedback and overall objective are considered. Reward design is not overall detrimental to achieve short-term objectives.
    2. Additional success bonus for successful episodes
    3. Return reward value
