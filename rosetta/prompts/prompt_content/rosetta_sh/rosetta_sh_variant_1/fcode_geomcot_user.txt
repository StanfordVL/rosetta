- Did you account for the fact that `.pos()` provides the **central** location? Common mistakes: 
  - Not applying correct offsets when attempting to position two objects in relation to each other. E.g. half-dimensions, radius values, etc.
- Did you consider the physical properties of each object and how they might affect target positions? Common mistakes: 
  - Thickness of container walls
- Did you recall that unlike standard configurations, x represents the forward-backward axis while y represents the left-right axis? z remains the vertical axis.
- When applying penalties, did you avoid EXCESSIVE penalization? For instance, if you desire reduced speed, penalizing ALL movement will cause the agent to become stationary and fail the task. Establish a threshold instead.

1. Verify.
2. If modifications are required, create minimal versions of them.
3. Only output methods you are modifying. 
4. If you are modifying a method, output the complete modified method, not just your changes.
5. Don't create new methods, not even utility methods. Just modify `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`. 
6. Add comments to your code as appropriate.
