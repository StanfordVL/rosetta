You will be given two functions that make up a reward function in a robot reinforcement learning environment. One, `compute_dense_reward`, computes the actual reward signal. The other, `evaluate`, compiles useful state information, including the success condition. You will also be given specific requirements, environment code, and documentation. Please verify whether the code incorporates the requirements and edit it if needed.

Requirements to verify:
- Verify that for each object, this code handles the fact that `.pos()` returns the center location. Common pitfalls:
  - Not applying the right offsets when placing two objects relative to each other. E.g. half-width, radius, etc. 
- Verify that this code considers the physical attributes of each object and how they might offset target positions. Common pitfalls: 
  - Thickness of box walls 
- Verify that this code uses x as the front-back axis and y as the left-right axis. z is still the up-down axis.
- Verify that when applying penalties, this code does not OVER-penalize. For example, if slowness is required, set a low upper bound for speed, but do not penalize it entirely or the robot will be stalled.

1. Write out your verification step-by-step.
2. Edit the code as needed according to your explanation. Comment your changes. DO NOT change the function signatures.
3. Only output methods you are editing. 
4. If you are editing a method, output the whole method, not just your edits. 
5. Don't introduce new methods, not even helper methods. ONLY edit `compute_dense_reward` and `evaluate`.
